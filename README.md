# Project6
Project 6 of CSC6301

Code includes sortedLinkedList.java -- which allows a user to enter numbers into a linked list and then sorts it.
The other is sortedStack.java which modifies the former, implementing Stack from a Linked List. Then is sorted as well.
I used VS Code to write my java code -- no extra packages are needed. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how easy it is to modify existing code, using collections, instead of inventing the wheel. 
Users can get started by copying the code and trying it on their own. 
The code is maintained by me, and I can be reached by my email in my bio. If you need any assistance please reach out.
